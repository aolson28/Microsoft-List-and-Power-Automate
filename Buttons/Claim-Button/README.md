This button component can be copied and pasted into a column formatter or a gallery view formatter. 

Typically, this would be in the "children: []" section of a div or other column display container.

This button is meant for the material handling system and writes to columns (that must be visible in the view) to trigger some notifications, change the status, and record metadata.

Claim button indicates that a material handler has claimed ownership of the request to ensure we don't have multiple handlers trying to fill the same request.
